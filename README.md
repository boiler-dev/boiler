# boiler

Boilerplate framework ðŸ¥˜

```bash
npm install -g boiler-dev
```

# Features

- Standardize & localize boilerplate development
- Save input prompt data for quick repeat installs
- Compile Typescript under same watch task as project (using [Project References](typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html))

# Boilerplate install flow

â“ª `cd` to your project
â‘  `boiler install [git repo]`
â‘¡ Boiler clones repo to `boilers/` and appends to `.gitignore`
â‘¢ Boiler prompts for input and installs boilerplate (using `boiler.ts`)
â‘£ Boiler saves repo and input to `boiler.json`

# Boilerplate update flow

â“ª `cd` to your project
â‘  `boiler update [boiler/my-boiler]`
â‘¡ `boiler install [boiler/my-boiler]`

# Create boilerplate flow

â“ª `cd` to your project
â‘  `boiler init boiler/my-boiler`
â‘¡ Hack on `boiler/my-boiler/boiler.ts`
â‘¢ `boiler install boiler/my-boiler`
â‘£ `boiler commit boiler/my-boiler "First commit"`

# Start a new project

In addition to creating boilerplate projects, the `boiler init` command creates a new TypeScript project:

```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project

boiler init
```

New projects use the following boilerplate:

- [package-json-boiler](https://github.com/boiler-dev/package-json-boiler)
- [ts-boiler](https://github.com/boiler-dev/ts-boiler)
- [eslint-prettier-ts-boiler](https://github.com/boiler-dev/eslint-prettier-ts-boiler)
- [release-boiler](https://github.com/boiler-dev/release-boiler)
